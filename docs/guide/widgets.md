2. The **Widget wizard** will be opened.
3. Choose a template for a widget (see them here) or go to the **“Choose from existing widgets”** section with a set of predefined widgets (look through them here). To simplify the process, fill in the search field with a name or part of a widget name.
4. Click on a widget to see its preview.
5. If you’ve chosen a template for a widget:
  * Click the **“Next”** button.
  * Set the necessary parameters. There are two types of them: basic and advanced ones. To see advanced parameters, click **“Show more”**.
