# Dashboards

Dashboard in Zebrunner is a special page that displays widgets with main analytical info on your test results.

A system General dashboard is displayed when you open Zebrunner (or press the **“Z”** button in the upper-left corner of the window). General is not editable – you cannot change its name or make it hidden.

In addition to General, you can create other dashboards to systemize widgets according to your needs.

**What can you do with dashboards?**

* Create Dashboards
* Edit Dashboards
* Make Dashboards Hidden
* Delete Dashboards
* Send Dashboards via email
* Search for Dashboards by name
* Change order of dashboards

## Create dashboard
To create a new dashboard, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the side menu and click the **“Dashboards”** icon. Then press the **“+Add dashboard"** button.
2. The **“New Dashboard”** popup will appear.
3. Enter a name of a new dashboard.
4. Click the **"Create"** button.

Now you can add widgets to the new dashboard.

## Edit dashboard
To edit a dashboard, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the side menu and click the **“Dashboards”** icon. Choose the necessary dashboard.
2. Click the pencil icon in the upper-right corner of the window.

5. Click the **“Save”** button.

The dashboard will be displayed with updates.

**Optional:** If you have **“Modify widgets”** and **“Modify dashboards”** permissions, you can edit a dashboard by applying a certain parameter to all the widgets on a dashboard (instead of setting it for each widget manually).

For example, you want to see your test results on a dashboard for the API platform only.

For this, perform the following steps:

2. Click **“Add”** and **“Save”**.
3. Refresh the page.

The dashboard will be displayed with updated results.

**Note:** You can apply several parameters to a dashboard. But you can add only 1 value to a parameter.

## Hidden dashboards
Dashboards in Zebrunner can be visible or hidden.

Hidden dashboards are useful when:

* You need to test and adjust experimental widgets to dashboards;
* You want to track your automation team performance on a special dashboard;
* You’d like to hide a dashboard from other users.

**Note:** You need the **“View hidden dashboards”** permission to make a dashboard hidden. Otherwise, you will not see this option.

To make a dashboard hidden, open **“New dashboard”** or **“Edit dashboard”** popup and turn on the switch **“Hidden”**.
